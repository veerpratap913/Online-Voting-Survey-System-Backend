## **📌 Features & Working of the Project**

### **🔹 User (Voter) Functionalities**
1️⃣ **User Registration & Login:**  
   - New users must register with **Name, Email, Password, and Constituency**.  
   - If already registered, users can log in and access their dashboard.  

2️⃣ **User Dashboard:**  
   - **User Details Section:** Displays the voter’s profile and constituency.  
   - **Candidates List:** Shows all election candidates in the user's constituency when the election is live.  
   - **Search Bar:** Allows users to search previous election results and other constituency details.  

3️⃣ **Voting Process:**  
   - Users can vote for any candidate **only during active elections**.  
   - Once a vote is cast, the **Vote button is disabled** to prevent multiple voting.  
   - In future elections, users can log in and vote again.  

4️⃣ **Real-Time Election Results:**  
   - Votes are updated **instantly** as users vote.  
   - The **party with the most votes is automatically ranked first**.  
   - Results are visible to everyone, ensuring transparency.
